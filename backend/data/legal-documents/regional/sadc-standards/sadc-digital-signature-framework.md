# SADC Digital Signature Framework (Summary)

**Note:** This document provides a summary of the SADC digital signature framework, which is part of the SADC Model Law on Electronic Transactions and E-commerce.

### Overview:

The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has established a legal framework for electronic signatures to create a secure legal environment and enhance regional integration. The SADC Model Law on Electronic Transactions and E-commerce was adopted in November 2012.

### Key Aspects:

*   **Validity of Electronic Signatures:** An electronic signature is considered valid if it complies with the requirements prescribed by regulation.
*   **Secure Electronic Signatures:** The framework allows for the accreditation of authentication products and services to be recognized as secure electronic signatures, consistent with internationally recognized technical standards.
*   **e-Certificate of Origin:** SADC has launched an electronic Certificate of Origin (e-CoO) to facilitate trade by processing and issuing certificates electronically. The e-CoO is designed to be paperless, reduce fraud, and increase the seamless flow of intra-regional trade.
*   **Implementation:** The SADC e-Certificate of Origin Framework was approved in 2019, with the goal for all member states to implement the e-CoO by 2024.
