# Contract Law in Botswana (Summary)

**Note:** This document provides a summary of the key aspects of contract law in Botswana.

### Overview:

Contract law in Botswana is derived primarily from Roman-Dutch and English common law principles, and is grounded in the Contract Act of 1967. The legal system is a dual system, with common law operating in parallel with customary law.

### Essential Elements of a Valid Contract:

*   **Offer and Acceptance**
*   **Intention to Create Legal Relations**
*   **Consensus ad idem (Meeting of the Minds)**
*   **Capacity to Contract**
*   **Certainty of Terms**
*   **Legality**
*   **Possibility of Performance**

Contracts can be oral or in writing, but written contracts are highly advisable. Electronic contracts are also legally binding.

### Breach of Contract and Remedies:

*   **Specific Performance**
*   **Interdict**
*   **Cancellation**
*   **Damages**

### The Role of the Courts:

The courts in Botswana play a crucial role in interpreting and enforcing contracts. The parol evidence rule is generally applied, meaning that extrinsic evidence cannot be used to contradict, alter, or add to the terms of a written contract.
