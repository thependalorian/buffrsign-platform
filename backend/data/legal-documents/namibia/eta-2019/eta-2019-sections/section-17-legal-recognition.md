# ETA 2019 Section 17: Legal Recognition of Data Messages

## Full Text

**Section 17. Legal recognition of data messages**

(1) No statement, representation, expression of will or intention, transaction or communication is without legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the ground that it is in the form of a data message.

(2) Despite subsection (1), persons may by agreement regulate the effect, use and requirements for data messages as it relates to dealings among themselves.

(3) Subject to this Act, any other law or any agreement, no public body may compel any person to interact with it by means of a data message.
