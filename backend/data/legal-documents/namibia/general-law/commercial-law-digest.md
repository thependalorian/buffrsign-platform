# Namibian Commercial Law Digest (Summary)

**Note:** This document provides a summary of key aspects of Namibian commercial law, with a focus on contract law. The primary sources of Namibian contract law are Roman-Dutch common law and statutes enacted by the Parliament of Namibia.

### Key Principles of Namibian Contract Law:

*   **Foundation:** Based on Roman-Dutch common law.
*   **Core Requirements:** A valid contract generally requires an offer, acceptance, and the intention to create a legally binding agreement.
*   **Unconscionable Contracts:** Contracts that are excessively one-sided and unfair to one party may be deemed unconscionable and unenforceable, especially where there is a significant imbalance in bargaining power.
*   **Statutory Influence:** The Namibian Constitution and specific legislation, like the Banking Institutions Act, contain provisions that can impact contracts.
*   **Case Law:** Decisions from the High Court and Supreme Court are crucial for interpreting and developing contract law principles. These can be found on the Namibian Superior Courts website.

For official legal documents and specific regulations, the Government Gazette of the Republic of Namibia is a primary source. Legal resources and publications from institutions like the Legal Assistance Centre in Namibia can also provide valuable information.
