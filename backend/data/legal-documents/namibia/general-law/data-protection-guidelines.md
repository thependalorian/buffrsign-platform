# Namibian Data Protection Guidelines (Summary)

**Note:** Namibia is in the process of establishing a comprehensive legal framework for data protection. While a specific, finalized "Data Protection Act" is not yet in force, a Draft Data Protection Bill has been in development.

### Current Situation:

*   **Draft Data Protection Bill:** The Namibian government has been working on a Draft Data Protection Bill. The bill aims to regulate the processing of personal information and establish a Data Protection Supervisory Authority. Several versions of this bill have been circulated for public comment.
*   **Constitutional Right to Privacy:** The Constitution of Namibia recognizes the right to privacy as a fundamental human right (Article 13).
*   **Current Legal Landscape:** Currently, Namibia does not have a single, comprehensive data protection law. Some sector-specific laws protect client information in areas like banking and legal services, but there is no overarching legislation governing data protection across all sectors.

Versions of the Draft Data Protection Bill can be found online from sources like the ACTION Namibia Coalition and the Cyrilla database of global digital rights law.
