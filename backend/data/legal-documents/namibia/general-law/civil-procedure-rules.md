# Namibian Civil Procedure Rules (Summary)

**Note:** This document provides a summary of key aspects of the Civil Procedure Rules in Namibia. The rules differ for the High Court, Supreme Court, and Magistrates' Courts.

### High Court of Namibia

The rules for the High Court have undergone significant changes, with a major update in 2014 introducing judicial case management.

*   **Current High Court Rules (As of 2014):** These rules introduced a new case management system. The official documents can be found on the ejustice portal of the Ministry of Justice.
*   **Previous High Court Rules (1990, as amended):** These were the rules in place prior to the 2014 update. While largely superseded, they may still be relevant for older cases or for understanding the historical context.

A comprehensive textbook, "Court-Managed Civil Procedure of the High Court of Namibia: Law, Procedure and Practice," explains the transition and application of the new rules.

### Supreme Court of Namibia

The Supreme Court has its own set of rules for proceedings before it. The Rules of the Supreme Court of Namibia (2017) can be found on the ejustice portal.

### Magistrates' Courts

For civil cases in the Magistrates' Courts, a different set of rules applies. The Law Society of Namibia provides access to these rules.
