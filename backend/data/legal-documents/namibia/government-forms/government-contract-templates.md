# Namibian Government Contract Templates (Summary)

**Note:** The Namibian government does not use simple "fill-in-the-blank" contract templates. Instead, it utilizes a structured system of documents, primarily in the form of Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs), governed by the Public Procurement Act 15 of 2015.

### Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs):

SBDs are comprehensive documents specific to the nature of the goods or services being procured. An SBD typically includes:

*   Instructions to Bidders
*   Bid Data Sheet
*   Evaluation and Qualification Criteria
*   Bidding Forms
*   General Conditions of Contract (GCC)
*   Special Conditions of Contract (SCC)
*   Scope of Work/Services and Performance Specifications
*   Contract Forms

### Key Authority:

The Ministry of Finance, through its Procurement Policy Unit, is central to the establishment of these procurement standards.

### Examples of SBDs:

Examples of SBDs and other contract-related documents from various Namibian government bodies are publicly available and provide insight into the format and content of government contracts. These can be found on the websites of the Ministry of Mines and Energy, AgriBusDev, NAMFISA, and NamRA.
