### Overview:

The Model Law on Electronic Commerce (MLEC) was developed by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) to help countries facilitate electronic commerce. It provides a set of internationally recognized rules to address legal obstacles and increase predictability for electronic transactions.

*   **Technological neutrality:** The Model Law is drafted to be neutral with respect to the technology used.
*   **Functional equivalence:** The Model Law establishes the functional equivalence of electronic and paper-based documents.
