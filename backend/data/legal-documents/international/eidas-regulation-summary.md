# eIDAS Regulation (Summary)

**Note:** This document provides a summary of the eIDAS (Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services) regulation in the European Union.

### Overview:

eIDAS is a European Union regulation that sets the standard for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions. It aims to create a more secure and efficient single European market for e-commerce.

### Key Aspects:

*   **Electronic Identification (eID):** It allows EU citizens to use their own national electronic identification to access public services in other EU countries.
*   **Trust Services:** eIDAS governs a range of trust services, including:
    *   **Electronic Signatures, Seals, and Timestamps:** It establishes standards for their creation and verification.
    *   **Qualified Web Authentication Certificates (QWACs):** These ensure the identity of websites.
    *   **Electronic Registered Delivery Services (ERDS):** These provide proof of sending and receiving data.
*   **Cross-Border Transactions:** A primary objective of eIDAS is to facilitate secure transactions across national borders within the EU.

In April 2024, an update to the regulation, known as eIDAS 2.0, was introduced. This update brings new trust services and provides a framework for the implementation of EU Digital Identity Wallets.

The United Kingdom has its own version of the regulation, UK eIDAS, which is an amended form of the EU regulation.
